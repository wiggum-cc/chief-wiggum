- Follow symlinks that point outside this workspace
- Execute commands that affect files outside this workspace

Your mission: Complete the next incomplete task from the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:

1. **Read the PRD**: Examine @$prd_relative to understand all tasks and requirements

2. **Identify Next Task**: Find the first incomplete task marked with (- [ ])
   - Tasks marked (- [x]) are complete - skip them
   - Tasks marked (- [*]) are failed - skip them
   - Focus on the first (- [ ]) task only

3. **Understand Requirements**: Before starting, ensure you understand:
   - What the task is asking for
   - What files need to be modified or created
   - What the acceptance criteria are
   - Any dependencies or constraints

4. **Execute the Task**: Implement the solution completely within your workspace
   - Write clean, secure, and maintainable code
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Add appropriate error handling
   - Include comments where logic is complex

5. **Verify Your Work**: Before marking complete, verify:
   - The implementation meets all requirements
   - Code works as expected (test if applicable)
   - No breaking changes to existing functionality

6. **Update PRD**: Mark the task status in @$prd_relative:
   - Change (- [ ]) to (- [x]) if successfully completed
   - Change (- [ ]) to (- [*]) if unable to complete (explain why in PRD)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Work on ONE task at a time - do not skip ahead
- Be thorough - partial implementations should be marked as (- [*])
- If you encounter blockers, document them clearly in the PRD
- All work must stay within the workspace directory"

To understand what was accomplished before the interruption:

Continue from where the previous session left off:
- Do NOT repeat work that was already completed
- Pick up where the previous session stopped
- If a task was partially completed, continue from where it left off
- Use the context to maintain consistency in approach and patterns

This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like file names, full code snippets, function signatures, file edits, etc
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
5. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
6. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
7. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests without confirming with the user first.
8. If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

3. Identify all files that were created or modified
4. Recall all technical decisions and their rationale
5. Document all testing and verification performed
6. Note any important patterns, conventions, or architectural choices
7. Consider what information would be most valuable for:
   - Future maintainers of this code
   - Code reviewers evaluating this work
   - Other developers working on related features

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Be specific with file paths, function names, and code patterns
- Include actual values for configurations, not placeholders
- Write for technical readers who may not have context
- Focus on WHAT was done and WHY, not just HOW
- Use proper markdown formatting for readability
- Be thorough but concise - every sentence should add value
