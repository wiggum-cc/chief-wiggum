WORKSPACE BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT:

Your allowed workspace is: $workspace and $prd_relative

CRITICAL SECURITY RULE:
- You MUST NOT cd into, read, or modify files outside this workspace
- You MUST NOT use relative paths that escape this workspace (e.g., ../../)
- You MUST NOT follow symlinks that point outside this workspace
- You MUST NOT execute commands that affect files outside this workspace

Prepend the following line to all subagent prompts:
<workspace>Your allowed workspace is: $workspace. Do not read or modify files outside of this directory</workspace>

TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL:

Your mission: Complete the next incomplete task from the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:

1. **Read the PRD**: Examine @../prd.md to understand all tasks and requirements

2. **Identify Next Task**: Find the first incomplete task marked with (- [ ])
   - Tasks marked (- [x]) are complete - skip them
   - Tasks marked (- [*]) are failed - skip them
   - Focus on the first (- [ ]) task only

3. **Understand Requirements**: Before starting, ensure you understand:
   - What the task is asking for
   - What files need to be modified or created
   - What the acceptance criteria are
   - Any dependencies or constraints

4. **Execute the Task**: Implement the solution completely within your workspace
   - Write clean, secure, and maintainable code
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Add appropriate error handling
   - Include comments where logic is complex

5. **Verify Your Work**: Before marking complete, verify:
   - The implementation meets all requirements
   - Code works as expected (test if applicable)
   - No breaking changes to existing functionality

6. **Update PRD**: Mark the task status in @../prd.md:
   - Change (- [ ]) to (- [x]) if successfully completed
   - Change (- [ ]) to (- [*]) if unable to complete (explain why in PRD)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Work on ONE task at a time - do not skip ahead
- Be thorough - partial implementations should be marked as (- [*])
- If you encounter blockers, document them clearly in the PRD
- All work must stay within the workspace directory

CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS SESSION (RESUMED):

This worker was previously interrupted and is now resuming.

To understand what was accomplished before the interruption:
- Read the file @../resume-context.md - it contains a summary of the previous session's work

Continue from where the previous session left off:
- Do NOT repeat work that was already completed
- Pick up where the previous session stopped
- If a task was partially completed, continue from where it left off
- Use the context to maintain consistency in approach and patterns

CRITICAL: Do NOT read files in the logs/ directory - they contain full conversation JSON streams that are too large (100KB-500KB each) and will deplete your context window.

CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS ITERATION:

This is iteration $iteration of a multi-iteration work session. Previous work has been completed in earlier iterations.

To understand what has already been accomplished and maintain continuity:
- Read the file @../iteration-$prev_iter-summary.txt to understand completed work and context
- This summary describes what was done, decisions made, and files modified
- Use this information to avoid duplicating work and to build upon previous progress
- Ensure your approach aligns with patterns and decisions from earlier iterations

CRITICAL: Do NOT read files in the logs/ directory - they contain full conversation JSON streams that are too large (100KB-500KB each) and will deplete your context window. Only read the iteration-X-summary.txt files for context.

FINAL COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY REQUEST:

Congratulations! All tasks in this work session have been completed successfully.

Your task is to create a comprehensive summary of EVERYTHING accomplished across all iterations in this session. This summary will be used in:
1. The project changelog (for other developers to understand what changed)
2. Pull request descriptions (for code review)
3. Documentation of implementation decisions

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure completeness. In your analysis:

1. Review all completed tasks from the PRD
2. Examine all iterations and their summaries (if multiple iterations occurred)
3. Identify all files that were created or modified
4. Recall all technical decisions and their rationale
5. Document all testing and verification performed
6. Note any important patterns, conventions, or architectural choices
7. Consider what information would be most valuable for:
   - Future maintainers of this code
   - Code reviewers evaluating this work
   - Other developers working on related features

Your summary MUST include these sections in this exact order:

<example>
<analysis>
[Your thorough analysis ensuring all work is captured comprehensively]

</summary>
</example>

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Be specific with file paths, function names, and code patterns
- Include actual values for configurations, not placeholders
- Write for technical readers who may not have context
- Focus on WHAT was done and WHY, not just HOW
- Use proper markdown formatting for readability
- Be thorough but concise - every sentence should add value
