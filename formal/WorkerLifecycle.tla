--------------------------- MODULE WorkerLifecycle ---------------------------
(*
 * TLA+ formal model of Chief Wiggum's worker lifecycle state machine.
 *
 * Faithfully encodes every transition from config/worker-lifecycle.json.
 * Transient states (fix_completed, resolved) are skipped atomically --
 * chains collapse into a single transition. merge_conflict is modeled
 * as a real state since it persists until a conflict.* event fires.
 *
 * Null-target transitions (resume.retry, task.reclaim) are omitted --
 * they don't change state.
 *
 * Designed for Apalache symbolic model checking (type annotations, CInit).
