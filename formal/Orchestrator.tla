---------------------------- MODULE Orchestrator -----------------------------
(*
 * TLA+ formal model of Chief Wiggum's multi-worker orchestrator.
 *
 * Models concurrent workers with inlined lifecycle transitions, shared
 * kanban board, worker pool capacity enforcement, and file conflict
 * detection.
 *
 * Models concurrent workers with 11 lifecycle states (including merge_conflict
 * and needs_multi_resolve routing) while preserving the key safety properties:
 *   - Worker pool capacity limits (main workers, priority workers)
 *   - No duplicate workers per task
 *   - Kanban consistency with worker state
 *   - Bounded merge/recovery counters
 *   - File conflict prevention
 *   - Dependency ordering
 *
 * Designed for Apalache symbolic model checking (type annotations, CInit).
