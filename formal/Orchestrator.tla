---------------------------- MODULE Orchestrator -----------------------------
(*
 * TLA+ formal model of Chief Wiggum's multi-worker orchestrator.
 *
 * Models concurrent workers with inlined lifecycle transitions, shared
 * kanban board, worker pool capacity enforcement, and file conflict
 * detection.
 *
 * EFFECT-STATE MODELING:
 * Models side effects as explicit per-task state variables to catch
 * partial-effect and crash-recovery bugs across concurrent workers:
 *   - inConflictQueue: whether task is queued for conflict resolution
 *   - worktreeState: worktree lifecycle (absent/present/cleaning)
 *   - lastError: error category from last failure
 *   - githubSynced: whether GitHub issue status matches kanban
 *
 * CRASH/RESTART MODELING:
 * Includes Crash actions that can interrupt any running worker, leaving
 * effects partially applied. StartupReset actions model orchestrator
 * restart recovery. Combined with effect-state, this catches:
 *   - "state updated but effect not applied" bugs
 *   - "effect applied but state not updated" bugs
 *   - cross-worker consistency violations after crash
 *
 * STARTUP RECONCILIATION (GAP CLOSURE #6):
 * Models _scheduler_reconcile_merged_workers() from scheduler.sh.
 * After mid-transition crashes, per-task effect-state variables (kanban,
 * conflict queue, GitHub sync, worktree, error) may be inconsistent with
 * lifecycle state. StartupReconcileMerged(t) and StartupReconcileConflict(t)
 * repair these inconsistencies on restart, achieving eventual consistency.
 *
 * STRUCTURED NONDETERMINISM:
 * Per-task baseMoved/hasConflict environment variables constrain merge
 * outcomes, preventing implausible state combinations.
 *
 * Safety properties include:
 *   - Worker pool capacity limits (main workers, priority workers)
 *   - No duplicate workers per task
 *   - Kanban consistency with worker state
 *   - Bounded merge/recovery counters
 *   - File conflict prevention
 *   - Dependency ordering
 *   - Conflict queue consistency with lifecycle state
 *   - Worktree state consistency
 *   - Error state consistency
 *   - Merged cleanup consistency
 *
 * Designed for Apalache symbolic model checking (type annotations, CInit).

\* Actions - Crash
\* Models process crash at two granularities:
\*   1. Pre-transition crash: process dies during running state before any
\*      transition fires. State unchanged, effects may be partial.
\*   2. Mid-transition crash: emit_event() wrote git_state_set() (atomic)
\*      but crashed before _lifecycle_update_kanban() or effects ran.
\*      State updated to target, kanban stale, effects not applied.
\*
\* The implementation's emit_event() applies changes sequentially:
\*   git_state_set -> kanban update -> event log -> effects
\* Each is individually atomic (temp+mv), but the sequence is not.
